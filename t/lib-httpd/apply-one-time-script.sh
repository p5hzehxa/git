# If "one-time-script" exists in $HTTPD_ROOT_PATH, run the script on the HTTP
# response. If the response was modified as a result, delete "one-time-script"
# so that subsequent HTTP responses are no longer modified.
#
# This can be used to simulate the effects of the repository changing in
# between HTTP request-response pairs.
#
# Apache can run this CGI for concurrent requests (for example a partial fetch
# that lazily fetches a missing object while the first response is still in
# flight), so the helper claims the marker atomically with a rename, and only
# once it has decided to modify the response. A request that loses the race
# finds the marker already gone and serves its response unchanged; no request
# is left emitting an empty body, which the server would report as HTTP 500.
# Scratch files are per-request ($$) so concurrent requests do not clobber each
# other.
